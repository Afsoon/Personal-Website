# Personal-Website

Welcome to the repository of my website. I'm building this website to expand my resume, showcase my skills, and let visitors see what I'm focusing on right now.

The website is under a redesign and active development at this moment of writing. Instead of trying to implement everything and deploy, I will iterate. The roadmap is the following:

- [X] Home page with some links
- [X] Resume page updated to December 2023
- [ ] Each work entry has its route where you can read my experience in more detail.
- [ ] Side projects
- [ ] Final Design
